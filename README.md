CSS3 (Flexbox, gradients, animations)

JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling)

How It Works
Buttons are wired up with JavaScript event listeners to update the counter value.

The counter value is displayed dynamically inside a large heading.

Each update triggers a smooth pulse animation to highlight the change.

The layout uses flexbox for arranging buttons and responsiveness.

CSS gradients and shadows create a modern, visually appealing pink theme.

Customization
Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, or animation speed by editing style.css. You can also extend the functionality by adding keyboard support or saving the counter state using localStorage.
